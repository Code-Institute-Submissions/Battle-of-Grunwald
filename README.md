# Site Design

## Compositon
* The Manrope font is used for headings in the site.
* Roboto font is used for the main text as it compliments Manrope, I also have a fall back of sans-serif as this is a general font that works well and is easy to read.
* Font Colour I have used is #080808 for headings and text.
* Images that have been Used fit with the purpose of my site and the event and time period displayed.

## Colour Scheme
* #080808 For text in body across the whole page to keep consistency.
* rgba(152, 152, 152, 0.3); For overall site background with a 0.3 transparency to reduce intensity.
* #ff8080 For hover function on navigation bar to enable user to see where they hover.
* #989898 For form background-color to make the form stand out.
* rgba(255,255,255, 0.5); For div elements in index.html and glossary.html to improve visibility and design.
* Using #080808 colour text against rgba(152, 152, 152, 0.3); background I have a score of AA 6.9 pass for accessibility.

## Bugs
I encountered a bug whilst improving responsiveness for mobile devices, I found an edge case between 420 and 440 px I had a difficulty with one character dropping on my h3 tags in the glossary.html
 making it look less than desireable I fixed this by increasing the font size temporarily with a media query to make more than one character drop to slightly improve design as there might be phones
 with that px size in the future.

I had an issue testing my responsiveness on contact page with iphone 5/SE (320px) where the content inside the form would not align how I would like, I created a media query to change the width to auto and this change made it look more in line.
