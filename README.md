# Introduction 
 <br>
 This website aims to educate on medieval facts and knowledge for users interested in the event in time.
 <br>
 My goal is to create a functioning and informative site detailing an event in the history of my country.
 <br>
 <br>



 # UX
The purpose of my project is to create a front-end only website for an event in history, which is regarded as an important battle in the history of Poland and Lithuania. 
My target audience for this project are users interested in the medieval history of the region.

## User Stories
* New users looking to improve their knowledge of the event.

    1.


* Returning users 
### I have included the following for my target audience

* A landing page with facts, images and information
* A contact page with a questionnaire for opinions and feedback
* Social media links 
* A glossary page with persons of interests .ie Commanders and weaponry

# Site Design

## Compositon
* The Manrope font is my choice of font for headings through the site, Roboto for the main font with having a fall back of sans-serif as this is a general font that works well and is easy to read.
* Colours Used
* Images Used are ones that fit with the purpose of my site and the event and time period I am using.

## Colour Scheme
* #080808 for text in body.
* rgba(152, 152, 152, 0.3); for site background with a 0.3 transparency to reduce intensity.
* #ff8080 for hover function on navigation bar.
* #989898 for form background-color.
* rgba(242, 38, 19, 0.8); for section in glossary.html.
* rgba(255,255,255, 0.5); as background for div to make text stand out.

# Testing

## Validation and Testing

### Devices

### Browsers
   
## Bugs
I encountered a bug whilst improving responsiveness for mobile devices, I found an edge case between 420 and 440 px I had a difficulty with one character dropping on my h3 tags in the glossary.html
 making it look less than desireable I fixed this by increasing the font size temporarily with a media query to make more than one character drop to slightly improve design as there might be phones
 with that px size in the future.

I had an issue testing my responsiveness on contact page with iphone 5/SE (320px) where the content inside the form would not align how I would like, I created a media query to change the width to auto and this change made it look more in line.

# Site Deployment

* The site was deployed to github Pages, below are the steps.
  1. In the github repository navigate to "settings"
  2. Scroll down to the "pages" tab
  3. In the github pages from the source drop down select main/master both are correct.
  4. Once you select main/master the page will automatically refresh and a link will be available
with succesful deployment.
