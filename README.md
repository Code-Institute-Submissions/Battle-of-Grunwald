### I have included the following for my target audience

* A landing page with facts, images and information
* A contact page with a questionnaire for opinions and feedback
* Social media links 
* A glossary page with persons of interests .ie Commanders and weaponry

# Site Design

## Compositon
* The Manrope font is my choice of font for headings through the site, Roboto for the main font with having a fall back of sans-serif as this is a general font that works well and is easy to read.
* Colours Used
* Images Used are ones that fit with the purpose of my site and the event and time period I am using.

## Colour Scheme
* #080808 for text in body.
* rgba(152, 152, 152, 0.3); for site background with a 0.3 transparency to reduce intensity.
* #ff8080 for hover function on navigation bar.
* #989898 for form background-color.
* rgba(242, 38, 19, 0.8); for section in glossary.html.
* rgba(255,255,255, 0.5); as background for div to make text stand out.
