                <p> Poland was baptised in 966 AD and in 1025 it became a kingdom recognised by the Pope and Holy Roman
                    Empire, the population slowly became christians. being surrounded by pagan tribes and kingdoms
                    created
                    tensions, in 1226 Konrad of Mazowia invited the German Teutonic order from Acre to help
                    protect the borders from the neighbouring pagan tribes they received chelmno land as a fief, Shortly
                    after the Holy Roman
                    Empire decreed that the rest of the Prussian lands be conquered.
                </p>
                <p> the teutonic order saw taking the lands and converting the populace
                    as a sacred duty.
                    by the year 1274 they had finished the task as the lands of Lithuania became christian.This strange
                    situation led to two wars, one in 1306 to 1308 which the Teutons took over the region of
                    Danzig. Poland also lost the
                    conflict between 1326 - 1332 losing claims to their northern teritories. in 1385 Poland created a
                    union
                    with Lithuania creating a mighty alliance, Teritory under the order in Samogotia rebelled in 1409
                    and
                    the Grand duchy of Lithuania sent aid.

                    The allies waited for the Teutons to make the first move otherwise the holy roman empire and Hungary
                    would get invloved, this is what happened in august 1409 and the orders Grandmaster ordered an
                    attack on
                    Poland and moved into Greater Poland and burned the castle of Dobryn as well as raiding the
                    surrounding
                    villages.
                </p>
                <p>The King of Bohemia asked the two forces to negotiate and a truce was signed until 1410.
                    Jogailla and Vytautas met in Brest to gather their forces and make an attack on the Teuton lands in
                    Prussia.
                </p>
                <p>They agreed to place all of their forces in northern Poland and move on the capital of the
                    order in Marienburg as soon as the truce ended, they organised raids on the border to distract the
                    main
                    Teuton force in Schwetz, The Poles crossed the border into Prussia on the 9th of July 1410 but they
                    were
                    discovered.</p>

                <p>
                    On the morning of 15th July the two opposing forces met between the villages of Grunwald,
                    Tannenberg(Stebark) and Ludwigsdorf(Lodwigowo) Poland known for its heavy cavalry were stationed on
                    the
                    left flank while the much lighter and faster Lithuanian cavalry made up the right flank and a
                    mixture of
                    mercenaries made up the center. The men were organised in three lines in a wedge shaped formation 20
                    men
                    deep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Teutonic forces were the first to organise their armies concentrated their heavy cavalry against
                    the
                    Lithuanians hoping to provoke an attack the heavy German knights were wearing heaving armour in
                    scorching sun for hours awaiting a move, they also attempted to use field artillery but some light
                    rain
                    dampened the gun powder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ulrich sent two swords to Vytautas and Jogailla to "assist" them in battle the swords were really
                    meant
                    as provocation and an insult.

                <p>
                    The assault started with Vytautas supported by Polish soldiers on the left flank of the enemy
                    suffering
                    heavy losses they retreated and returned later on in the battle. while they were retreating there
                    was
                    heavy fighting on the Polish right flank Ulrich personally led 16 banners of men roughly one third
                    of
                    his whole army while Jogailla deployed all of his reserves to the fight and almost being killed but
                    was
                    saved by his secretary Zbigniew Olesnicki.

                    Towards the end of the battle the Lithuanians returned attackign Ulrich von Jungingen in the rear at
                    this point the Teutons were outnumbered from all sides. Ulrich was killed by a lance through his
                    neck,
                    his killer is disputed. After his death the Teutonic forces began retreating.

                <p>
                    The aftermath of the battle showed a resounding Polish-Lithuanian Victory, Numbers have been highly
                    disputed but the commonly accepted number is 39,000 for the allies and 27,000 for the Teutons which
                    lost
                    around 20,000 men with 14,000 taken as prisoners, Poland and Lithuania lost around 2,000 soldiers
                    including only 12 knights.
